# Amazon-like
Week 12 HW using mySQL

## Overview

In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this unit. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus you can create a manager role that view and add to the stock as needed.
